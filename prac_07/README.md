## About This Repository

This repository contains my practical work for the subject CP1404.  
Each practical folder includes exercises and reflections based on weekly topics.

## Lessons I've Learned About Clean Code

- Use meaningful and consistent naming for variables, functions, and classes.
- Write small, single-purpose functions that do one thing well.
- Always comment and document your code clearly, especially using docstrings.
